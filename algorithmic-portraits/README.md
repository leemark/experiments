# Algorithmic Portraits

This is a creative coding project using p5.js to generate unique portrait art based on algorithms.

## Features (Initial Setup)

*   **Basic Structure:** Sets up the HTML, CSS, and p5.js sketch.
*   **Portrait Generation:** Clicking the "Generate New Portrait" button creates a new, simple face.
*   **Random Seed:** Each portrait is generated using a unique random seed, ensuring reproducibility if the seed is known.
*   **Placeholder Face:** Draws a basic randomized head shape, eyes, nose, and mouth as a starting point.

## How to Run

1.  Clone or download this project.
2.  Navigate to the `algorithmic-portraits` directory.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
4.  Click the "Generate New Portrait" button to see different variations.

## Planned Features (from Project Plan)

*   **Face Structure Framework:** Define better facial proportion guidelines.
*   **Advanced Feature Generation:** Implement algorithms for diverse eyes, noses, mouths, ears, hair.
*   **Style Development:** Create distinct artistic styles (Cubist, Impressionist, Minimalist, Glitch).
*   **Color Theory:** Implement sophisticated color palette generation and skin tones.
*   **Personality System:** Link expressions to traits, add subtle animation.
*   **Background & Composition:** Generate complementary backgrounds and apply composition rules.
*   **Interactive Controls:** Allow user influence over generation parameters.
*   **Evolution/Iteration:** Implement genetic algorithms or history tracking.
