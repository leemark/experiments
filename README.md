## Project Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ | Completed |
| 🔜 | Coming Soon |
| 🚧 | In Progress |

## 1. Generative Cityscape ✅
- **Description**: Create a dynamic cityscape that evolves over time. Buildings grow and shrink, lights turn on and off, and the skyline changes with the time of day.

## 2. Interactive Kaleidoscope ✅
- **Description**: Develop an interactive kaleidoscope that responds to mouse movements. Users can create intricate patterns by moving their cursor across the canvas.

## 3. Sound-Responsive Visualizer 🔜
- **Description**: Build a visualizer that reacts to sound input. Use the microphone to capture audio and generate visuals that pulse and change with the music.

## 4. Fractal Forest ✅
- **Description**: Design a forest of fractal trees that grow and sway in the wind. Each tree is unique, and the forest changes with the seasons.

## 5. Particle Swarm Art 🔜
- **Description**: Create a swarm of particles that follow the mouse cursor. The particles leave trails that form beautiful, flowing patterns.

## 6. Digital Watercolor Painting 🔜
- **Description**: Simulate a watercolor painting that users can interact with. Brush strokes blend and bleed into each other, creating a realistic painting experience.

## 7. 3D Geometric Sculpture 🔜
- **Description**: Construct a 3D sculpture using geometric shapes. The sculpture rotates and changes shape based on user input, creating a dynamic piece of art.

## 8. Algorithmic Portraits 🚧
- **Description**: Generate portraits using algorithms. Each portrait is unique, created from a set of rules that define facial features and expressions.

## 9. Virtual Garden 🔜
- **Description**: Design a virtual garden that grows and changes over time. Users can plant seeds and watch as flowers bloom and wither.

## 10. Stellar Constellations 🔜
- **Description**: Create a night sky filled with stars and constellations. Users can explore the sky, discovering new constellations and learning about the stars.
