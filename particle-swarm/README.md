# Particle Swarm Art

This is a creative coding project using p5.js to simulate an artistic particle swarm.

## Features

*   **Particle System:** Creates a defined number of particles.
*   **Flocking Behavior:** Particles exhibit classic flocking behavior:
    *   **Separation:** Avoid crowding nearby particles.
    *   **Alignment:** Steer towards the average direction of neighbors.
    *   **Cohesion:** Steer towards the average position of neighbors.
*   **Mouse Interaction:** Particles are attracted to the mouse cursor when it's nearby.
*   **Trails:** A slight background fade creates visual trails behind the particles.
*   **Wrapping Edges:** Particles wrap around the screen edges.

## How to Run

1.  Clone or download this project.
2.  Navigate to the `particle-swarm` directory.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

Move your mouse over the canvas to interact with the swarm!
